# Experiments Structure

- Keep each experiment in `Experiments/exp-YYYYMMDD-short-name/`.
- Start from `Experiments/_template/` and fill `hypothesis.md` before coding.
- Put scripts or notebooks in `code/` and note the entry point in `code/README.md`.
- Record outcomes and decisions in `results.md`, linking any outputs or figures.
- If an experiment changes project direction or outputs, update `CONTEXT.md`.
