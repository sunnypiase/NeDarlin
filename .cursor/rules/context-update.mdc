# Context Update Rule

Update `CONTEXT.md` whenever you make an important change.

Important change includes:
- New data sources, schema changes, or data quality notes
- Changes to project goals, assumptions, or key outputs
- Behavior changes in scripts, analyses, or results
- Structural changes (new modules, workflows, or pipelines)

How to update:
- Add a new entry under "Recent Changes" with date
- Include summary, affected files, reason, and follow-ups
- Keep entries short and factual
