# Experiments

This folder keeps each experiment self-contained with its hypothesis, code, and results.

## Structure

- `exp-YYYYMMDD-short-name/`
  - `hypothesis.md`
  - `code/`
  - `results.md`

## Start a new experiment

1. Copy `Experiments/_template/` to a new folder named `exp-YYYYMMDD-short-name/`.
2. Fill in `hypothesis.md` before writing code.
3. Add scripts or notebooks under `code/`.
4. Write findings and decisions in `results.md`, linking any outputs.
